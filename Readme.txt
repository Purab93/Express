Just open command window at this location and run the command "node index.js".
The server will start on port 3000.
In the browser enter the address "http://localhost:3000/".

Further have integrated the flickr photo API with it so to use it type "http://localhost:3000/car" or "http://localhost:3000/bike".
So basically whatever one needs to search write it at the end and it will show the results.
